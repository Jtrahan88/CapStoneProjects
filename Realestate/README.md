# Purpose:
* I would like to start buying Rental income homes to help build for my retirement. 


## Problems:
My goals for here will be the following:
* What are houses selling for by parish, city, area?
* What is the median/mean rent for all of the above and add neighborhoods as well?
* What are the Section 8 housing rents looking like?
* Make a Live calculator that will give use an estimate of the total cost of a home (15 vs 30 years),
* Monthly payment, and a place to add our own variable cost if needed. Using APIs for the following:
-Interest rates (min and Max across the country).
- Housing prices/sold prices state/nation wide
* Creating not just a mortgage calculate as well as a Rental calculator
- Rental calculator will have ROI, ROI debt payment over 5 years, Cap rate etc.
- This will help us determine quickly if we should buy this home or not. 
### Terms to define and to know what is teh best %/gain/Loss for todays market)
* Define ROI
* Define 1% rule
* Define Cap Rate
* Define NOI
* Define Cash on Cash return
* Calculate all expenses:
-Taxes
-Insurance
- Trash
- Gas/electric
- Water/Sewer
- Heat
- Lawn/Snow
- Extra
- Cap ex*** find out more on this
- Maintenance
- Vacancy
- Management
* Calculate all Returns:
- NOI income
- CAP Rate
- Cash on Cash return
- Total NOI
- Monthly NOI
- Principal and intrest(Negative)
- Return on intial investment, Year(Should be a %)

## Solutions:
* Will use *Python* to min and clean the data.
* Will use *SQL* to sore the data base in. This may be extra helpful because I am thinking about doing this for each state.
* Will use *Tableau* share my findings, as well as try to set up a calculator for a basic mortgage and rental properties gain/losses.

## Conclusion::
The main goal is to anser the questions above so we can get a better idea quickly if we should start to look into buy the home.s in questions. This will not help with due deligance(grandfather clauses, inspections, etc) and will have more to research. But this will at least give us a final overview so we can see if teh home in question is worth spendig time on/buying.
#### Next steps:
*this will be completly once teh project is done.*
