# Will build multiple Database to improve my SQL skills.

# Using SQL in Your Web Site
#### To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
* An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
* To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
* To use SQL to get the data you want
* To use HTML / CSS to style the page

# RDBMS
* RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
* RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
* The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.


## Terms/commands to know for each database aspec:

* \c - This will connect to the date base we would like to enter.
* \d <table_name> - will show information about the specific table
* \d 0 this will check the tables inside the database
* \l - list database, tables, columns, etc.
* ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name; - rename a data base
* ALTER Table <table_name> ADD COLUMN <column_name> DATATYPE - This will alter teh table to add a column. We will need to label the datatype the column is.
* ALTER TABLE <table_name> DROP COLUMN <column_name> - will drop a columns from a table
* ALTER TABLE <table_name> RENAME COLUMN <column_name> TO <new_name>; - Change name of a column

* ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name; - Drop a constraint like a primary key.
* CREATE DATABASE - This will creat a database from teh terminal into postgresSQL
* CREATE TABLE (); 0 This will create a table in the current data base
* DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; - delete the record you entered with a condition
* DROP DATABASE <Database_name>; - Drops an entire database.
* DROP TABLE table_name; - Drops a table from teh database
* INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2); - Add row values to teh database
* Multiple row entries at once: -
>> * INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color)
>> * VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'),
>> * ('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green'),
>> * ('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');
* psql --username= dbname=postgres - Connect to a PostgresSQL data base
* SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name; - order columns.
* SELECT columns FROM table_name; - selects a column in the table
* TRUNCATE TABLE - command deletes the data inside a table, but not the table itself
* UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition; - updates a row value.
